# Keyboard-Drums
A simple keyboard drumkit written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS.

To get started, simply clone the repo, navigate to the project directory in your console of choice, and run the command: "npm start"

A browser tab should then open and display the app running on localhost:3000.

Enjoy!
